            <h1>Wonderful.<br><span>Island</span></h1>
            <p>This tour was a perfect introduction to our time in Seychelles. Our tour guide took us all over the main
                island, from the most beautiful lookout spot to the spice gardens with the famous Coco de mer. We
                learned lots about the islands agriculture & industries, along with many other interesting facts.

            <h1>Road Trip.<br><span>Together</span></h1>
            <p>There is something very exotic and romantic about train journeys that one cannot explain using mere
                words. Everybody loves a window seat in a train and it doesn't matter how old you are, you'd always
                yearn for a window seat so that you can observe the pleasant countryside through which your train is
                scampering wild to its destination.

            <h1>Feel Nature.<br><span>Relax</span></h1>
            <p>
                Nature travel offers the thrill of discovering something new, or at the very least, something only a
                fraction of people have seen in person. Feel the delight of taking in scenic views from a crisp
                mountaintop while a doe silently wanders below with her fawn, or the excitement of snorkeling at an
                untouched coral reef.

            <h1>Hiking.<br><span>Enjoy</span></h1>
            <p>Hiking is a physical activity aiming at recreation, training, and physical fitness. As a rule, people are
                engaged in this activity during vacations. However, very often, hiking is the main motive for
                travelling. This very fact allows us to refer to hiking as a distinct type of tourism, being the very
                reason to make a trip
